For the Python D&D 5E Project:

1. Use classes to modify states of a Character
 - combat state (initiative, combat actions as instances, such as dodge)
 - advantage/disadvantage state
 - status conditions as states
 - death saves (part of unconscious state)
 - conecentration state
 - rage state (for barbarian)
 - inspiration state (created through Bard)
 - spells that cause states, like faerie fire (class method?)

2. Monster class to define monsters from the monster manual (use Beholder for example)
 - combat state to define lair actions during initiative
 - attacks based on monster properties

3. Weapons class, Armor class
 - divide weapons into their separate types, define if proficiency with them is true or not
 - divide armor into their separate types (light, medium, heavy)

4. Subclasses as child class of Classes (1 per character class)
 - think about multiclassing (probably not doing this)
